// scskiller preloader: placed beside a Streamline game's exe under a DLL name the exe imports statically (winmm.dll,
// version.dll or dinput8.dll as built, or another System32 DLL's name with an export table the app writes: PreloadPe.cs).
// Static imports initialise before the game's code, so the recorder (d3d12.dll beside it) is loaded before Streamline's
// first by-name load of d3d12.dll, which the loader then hands the recorder. Every export jumps to the System32 DLL of this
// file's name (preload.asm). Without a d3d12.dll beside it, it is only that forwarder.
//
// The recorder is loaded in DllMain, under the loader lock: nothing later comes before the game's code. It runs on the
// initial thread during process start, and a deadlock needs a wait on another thread: this DllMain waits on nothing (no
// CRT, kernel32 only), the System32 DLLs it loads import only system DLLs whose DllMains don't wait, and the recorder's
// DllMain already runs at this point in games whose static imports pull in d3d12.dll.
